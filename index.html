	<P> Replicka was formed in the winter of 2012 by musicians Forde Weaver and Aditya Bhatia during their freshman year of high school. The two began making experimental electronic music and eventually released their
	first album, "Incommunicado", which was a local hit. As high school went on and Aditya eventually left the band, the project became Forde's solo music outlet, and he released the self-titled album "Replicka" during his
	senior year, which was met with even more local success.</P>
	<P>When Forde moved to Athens, GA to attend the University of Georgia, he decided that he wanted to form his solo project into a band, recruiting Jordan Hicks on
	the drums and Evan Ayers on the lead guitar. The group played a few shows in the Athens area during Forde's freshman year, and in his sophomore year, Ayers left the band and was replaced with two new members: Olivier
	Poulin (guitar) and James Norton (bass). Since then, the band has been working on a new album called <em>"Thank You For Wasting All My Time"</em> and is planning to release it in the spring of 2018. Until then, they will be
	playing many shows in and around the Athens area. They will appreciate any support they can receive!</P>
